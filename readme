DAO : relate method call to the query. execute it and return result.

RoomDatabase : Need single instance for complete app, uses databasebuilder, and database callbacks,
               populate database login in database callbacks.

Communication and execution:

- app uses viewmodel to observe change in data.
- Viewmodel uses application context to init roomDB, this RoomDB gives DAO instance. which used to get
  repository instance and through that instance viewmodel can insert data and gets the updated data.
- Repository had wrapper methods like insert and getdata for the same DAO methods. So it is kind of single source
  communication. So repository used as point where we can build loginc to fetch data from whether server or DB itself.
- roomDB populate the database first time and adds the some sample data into it.
